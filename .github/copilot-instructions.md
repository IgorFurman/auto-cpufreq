## AI CODING ASSISTANT RULES
* When asked to configure fan control, create comprehensive solutions that manage all system fans intelligently, including CPU and GPU fans.
* Aim for aggressive cooling strategies, especially when the user indicates a high-performance setup. For example, setting system fans to HIGH speed even when the CPU is at a medium temperature.
* Provide real-time monitoring, automatic startup on boot, integration with `auto-cpufreq`, and comprehensive logging for fan control systems.
* Generate comprehensive README files to document all configurations.
* When fixing URLs, ensure they start with `http://` or `https://`.
