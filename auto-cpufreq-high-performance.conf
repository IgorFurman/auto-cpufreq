# auto-cpufreq configuration optimized for AMD Ryzen 9 3900X - MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE
# 12-core/24-thread high-performance processor with aggressive cooling

# Settings for when connected to a power source (AC adapter)
[charger]
# Use performance governor for maximum performance
governor = performance

# Set minimum frequency to 3800 MHz (base clock)
# This ensures the CPU never drops below its base frequency
scaling_min_freq = 3800000

# Set maximum frequency to 4670 MHz (close to max boost)
# Your CPU max is ~4.6 GHz, using 4670 MHz for stability
scaling_max_freq = 4670000

# Always enable turbo boost for maximum performance
turbo = always

# Settings for when using battery power (if applicable)
[battery]
# Use performance governor even on battery
governor = performance

# Set minimum frequency to 2200 MHz on battery
scaling_min_freq = 2200000

# Set maximum frequency to 4200 MHz on battery
scaling_max_freq = 4200000

# Use turbo boost automatically on battery
turbo = auto
