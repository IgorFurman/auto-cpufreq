I'll help you run auto-cpufreq in monitor mode. Based on the README, the monitor mode allows you to see what auto-cpufreq could do for your system without making any actual changes. It seems the command didn't return any output. Let me check if auto-cpufreq is installed and available on your system: Good! auto-cpufreq is installed. Let me try running the monitor command again with some additional output:

_**User**_

got it

_**Assistant**_

Great! It looks like you understand how to run auto-cpufreq in monitor mode. Just to summarize, the monitor mode command is:

```bash
sudo auto-cpufreq --monitor
```

This mode will show you what auto-cpufreq could do for your system without actually making any changes. It's a safe way to see the recommendations and understand how the tool would optimize your CPU performance and power management.

If you want to try other modes later:
- `sudo auto-cpufreq --live` - Apply changes temporarily (until reboot)
- `sudo auto-cpufreq --install` - Install as a permanent daemon service
- `auto-cpufreq --stats` - View stats if the daemon is installed

Is there anything specific about auto-cpufreq you'd like to explore or configure?

I'll help you create an optimal auto-cpufreq configuration for your AMD Ryzen 9 3900X processor. Let me first check if there's already a config file, then create a customized one for your CPU. Let me check what governors and energy performance preferences are available on your system: Now I'll create an optimized configuration for your AMD Ryzen 9 3900X. This is a high-performance 12-core processor, so I'll configure it for optimal performance when plugged in and power savings on battery:

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll create an optimized auto-cpufreq configuration for your AMD Ryzen 9 3900X focused on maximum performance. Let me create the config file using sudo: Perfect! Now let's verify the configuration was created correctly: Excellent! Now let's test the configuration with auto-cpufreq monitor mode to see how it would perform: Perfect! The configuration is working excellently. Let me press Ctrl+C to exit the monitor and then show you what we've achieved: ## ✅ **Maximum Performance Configuration Created Successfully!**

I've created an optimized auto-cpufreq configuration for your AMD Ryzen 9 3900X that focuses on **maximum performance**. Here's what the configuration provides:

### **🔥 Performance Settings (AC Power):**
- **Governor**: `performance` - Maximum performance mode
- **Min Frequency**: `3800 MHz` - Never drops below base clock
- **Max Frequency**: `4670 MHz` - Near maximum boost for peak performance
- **Turbo**: `always` - Aggressive boost behavior for maximum performance

### **🔋 Battery Settings (Optimized for performance while on battery):**
- **Governor**: `performance` - Maintains high performance even on battery
- **Min Frequency**: `2200 MHz` - Still quite high for excellent responsiveness
- **Max Frequency**: `4200 MHz` - High performance ceiling on battery
- **Turbo**: `auto` - Smart boost management to balance performance/battery

### **📊 Monitor Results Show:**
- CPU cores boosting to **4100-4200+ MHz** consistently
- **Performance governor** being applied correctly
- **Turbo boost** working as configured
- All **24 threads** (12 cores) being utilized effectively
- Temperatures stable around **67-71°C** (excellent for high performance)

### **⚠️ Important Notes:**
1. **GNOME Power Profiles Warning**: The system detected GNOME Power Profiles daemon running, which can conflict with auto-cpufreq. This will be automatically disabled when you install the daemon.

2. **High Performance = Higher Power Consumption**: This configuration prioritizes performance over power savings, so expect:
   - Higher CPU temperatures under load
   - Increased power consumption
   - Reduced battery life (if applicable)

### **🚀 Next Steps:**
To activate this configuration permanently, install the auto-cpufreq daemon:
```bash
sudo auto-cpufreq --install
```

This will:
- Install the daemon as a systemd service
- Apply your performance configuration automatically
- Start optimizing immediately and on every boot
- Disable conflicting power management services

Your AMD Ryzen 9 3900X is now configured for **maximum performance**! 🎯

**Option 2: Monitor fan performance in real-time:**
```bash
# Watch CPU fan control
sudo journalctl -fu cpu-fan-control

# Watch GPU fan control  
sudo journalctl -fu gpu-fan-control

# Watch all temperatures
watch -n 2 sensors
```

**Option 3: Adjust fan curves if needed:**
```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/cpu-fan-control
# Modify TEMP_* and PWM_* values for custom curves
sudo systemctl restart cpu-fan-control
```
